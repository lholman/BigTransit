# 2. Use monorepo for backend and infrastructure

Date: 2024-05-08

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the Big Transit project grows we want to manage and maintain its interconnected parts, including the backend API code, tests and Infrastructure as Code.

## Decision

We will use a Monorepo structure for the Big Transit repository. This structure will be maintained and documented clearly within the README.md

## Consequences

* It may be a little heavy of a structure upfront 
* Once in place it will make it easy to iterate and add new features while keeping things organised
